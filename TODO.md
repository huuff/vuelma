# Tasks
* Use my `BaseBreadcrumb` to show the path in all parts of the example!
* Improve the dropdown component so much that it works seamlessly in the navbar comonent (maybe using `$parent`?) That it detects that it's in a navbar and applies the correct classes (since dropdowns are different in both)
* Maybe do as above for card modals? Looks hard.
* Maybe do this for tabs in panels? Just a dream
* Visual regression tests?
* For the menu example get it to work for changing the active item
* Alignment for those components that allow it?
* Do something with injection symbols. (At least, put them in the same folder as the clients? Maybe generalize it somehow)
* Remove as many warnings as I can
* Fix the display of the navbar example
