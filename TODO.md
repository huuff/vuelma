# Tasks
* Use my `BaseBreadcrumb` to show the path in all parts of the example!
* Maybe do this for tabs in panels? Just a dream
* Visual regression tests?
* Alignment for those components that allow it?
* Remove as many warnings as I can
* Fix the display of the navbar example
* Passthrough classes to my children elements, e.g. a panel block should accept classes and render them in the final element. (I think I do this for `NavbarItem`s)
* A `RouterNavbar`?

## Things I can't do until [this issue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/6911) gets solved
* Test `BaseNavbar`
* Test `BaseMenu`
* Test `BaseDropdown`
* Test `BasePanel`
