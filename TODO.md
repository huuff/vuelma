# Tasks
* Should `BaseBreadcrumb` really be `Basebreadcrumb`? It seems like generating it from a router might be too specific so I'm afraid it's not so "base".
* Use my `BaseBreadcrumb` to show the path in all parts of the example!
* Improve the dropdown component so much that it works seamlessly in the navbar comonent (maybe using `$parent`?) That it detects that it's in a navbar and applies the correct classes (since dropdowns are different in both)
* Maybe do as above for card notifications? Looks hard.
* Should I go back to using two-way binding for closing/opening messages and modals?
* For pagination, some inputs to define number of pages and current page in the example
* Visual regression tests?
* For the menu example get it to work for changing the active item
* Alignment for those components that allow it?
