# Tasks
* Visual regression tests?
* Remove as many warnings as I can
* A `RouterNavbar`?
* Actually, change everything to normal render functions so I can test them
* Try to test components that have no TSX
* Try to rehash pagination into some sort of superpowerful scoped slot

## Things I can't do until [this issue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/6911) gets solved
* Test `BaseNavbar`
* Test `BaseMenu`
* Test `BaseDropdown`
* Test `BasePanel`
* Test `BaseTabs`
* Test `BaseBreadcrumb`
