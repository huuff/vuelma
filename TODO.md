# Tasks
* Visual regression tests?
* Remove as many warnings as I can
* Recreate all of Bulma's official site examples? (In different pages)

## Things I can't do until [this issue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/6911) gets solved
* Update: Now I can! Since I removed all TSX
* Test `PaginatedSlot`
